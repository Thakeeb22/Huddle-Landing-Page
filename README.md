## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
Some of the things i learnt from this project is using both css grid and flexbox to get the layout of the website more functional. and it was indeed more powerful

### Continued development

I want to continue exploring the mixture of flexbox and css grid to build more responsive web layouts.
